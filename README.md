# Unidecode

## Description

A library for converting unicode text into a somewhat readable Ascii-only form.
Compatible with data from the following libraries
* https://github.com/avian2/unidecode
* http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Unidecode 

## Usage
```js
import unidecode from "@chacha-26/unidecode";
const example = "ùï∑ùñîùñóùñäùñí ùñéùñïùñòùñöùñí ùñâùñîùñëùñîùñó ùñòùñéùñô ùñÜùñíùñäùñô";
console.log(unidecode(example)); // "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
```

## Development
* Generate data:      `node task data [perl | python]`
* Build source files: `node task build`
* Run tests:          `node task test`
* Delete generated files: `node task clean`

## Data acquisition
This library is compatible with the following sources:
* **Python (avian2/unidecode)**:
  Available as a git submodule. To download the latest version, run: 
  ```shell
  git submodule update --init
  ```
  from the project root.
* **Perl (Text::Unidecode)**:
  Not available as a git submodule. Download the .tar.gz archive from http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Unidecode and extract the folder somewhere. Open `src/generate_data.perl.ts` and update the `SRC_DIR` variable to point to the folder containing the `x00.pm`, `x01.pm`, ..., `xff.pm` files.

Once you have installed at least one of the data sources, you can run `node task build perl` or `node task build python` to generate usable `.js` files.
